# RECCAP2 : Southern-Ocean Analysis and Figures
code for data analysis and figure creation of the Southern Ocean chapter of RECCAP 2

## Figures 

Figures are organised based on common datasets used and who created the figures. For example, all $p\mathrm{CO}_2$-related figures are grouped in the same folder.

The following initials refer to the creators:

- `cn` = Cara Nissen
- `jh` = Judith Hauck
- `lg` = Luke Gregor (gregorl@ethz.ch)
- `lp` = Lavinia Patara
- `mh` = Mark Hague

### Data

We provide scripts to process the raw data from the RECCAP2 repository on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7990822). 
However, we also provide the aggregated data used to create the figures.
