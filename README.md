# RECCAP2 : Southern-Ocean Analysis and Figures
code for data analysis and figure creation of the Southern Ocean chapter of RECCAP 2

## Figures 

Figures are organised based on common datasets used and who created the figures. For example, all $p\mathrm{CO}_2$-related figures are grouped in the same folder.
The scripts in each folder may have their own requirements. See the folder-level README files to find out what the package requirements are. 

The following initials refer to the creators:

- `cn` = Cara Nissen (cara.nissen@awi.de)
- `jh` = Judith Hauck (Judith.Hauck@awi.de)
- `lg` = Luke Gregor (gregorl@ethz.ch)
- `lp` = Lavinia Patara (lpatara@geomar.de)
- `mh` = Mark Hague (mark.hague@usys.ethz.ch)

### Data

We provide scripts to process the raw data from the RECCAP2 repository on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7990822). 

The aggregated data used to create the figures can be found in the RECCAP2-SO repository on Zenodo (URL to be added). These files should be placed in the `data` directory.
