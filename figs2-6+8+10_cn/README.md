## Data

All scripts require a download of the full RECCAP2 dataset. The full dataset can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7990822](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7990822).

In addition, the notebook [RECCAPv2_SO_Fig10_CO2_flux_trends.ipynb](RECCAPv2_SO_Fig10_CO2_flux_trends.ipynb) requires satellite-based SST data, in particular NOAAâ€™s Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature, version 5 (ERSSTv5). These data can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.7289/V5T72FNM](https://doi.org/10.7289/V5T72FNM) (last access August 30, 2023).
